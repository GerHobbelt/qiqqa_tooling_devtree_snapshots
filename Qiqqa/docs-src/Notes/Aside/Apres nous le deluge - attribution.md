## Dutch original (quoted [from here](https://www.ensie.nl/katholieke-encyclopaedie/apres-nous-le-deluge))

Après nous le déluge = Na ons de zondvloed. 

Deze woorden zouden afkomstig zijn van de markiezin de Pompadour; bij ’n onbekenden Griekse [dichter](https://www.ensie.nl/katholieke-encyclopaedie/dichter) komt eenzelfde [gedachte](https://www.ensie.nl/katholieke-encyclopaedie/gedachte) op, die [Cicero](https://www.ensie.nl/katholieke-encyclopaedie/cicero) en [Seneca](https://www.ensie.nl/zelfstudie/seneca) aanhalen, en in keizer Tiberius’ mond lag die (vlg. [Cassius](https://www.ensie.nl/katholieke-encyclopaedie/cassius) Dio 58. 23) bestorven.

Keizer Nero voegde bij het aanhalen dezer woorden eraan toe: „Nog liever tijdens mijn leven” (Suetonius’ Nero 38) — de brand van Rome! — dus: laten we er dan maar op los leven. De Pompadour’s uitdrukking in Mémoires de Mad. du Hausset, Essai sur la marquise de Pompadour (1824, 19).

## English translation

Après nous le déluge = After us the deluge.

These words are said to come from the [Marquise de Pompadour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_de_Pompadour); with a Greek poet unbeknownst to us the same thought arises, which [Cicero](https://www.ensie.nl/catholic-encyclopaedie/cicero) and Seneca quoted, and an _old saw_ Emperor Tiberius never hesitated to share (cf. [Cassius](https://www.ensie.nl/Catholic-encyclopaedie/cassius) Dio 58. 23).

Emperor Nero, in quoting these words, added: “Better within my lifetime” (Suetonius' Nero 38)​ — the fire of Rome! — ergo: let's just live it up / live like there's no tomorrow. De Pompadour's expression in *Mémoires de Mme. du Hausset, Essai sur la marquise de Pompadour* (1824, 19, *Memoirs of Madame Du Hausset, Maid of Madame de Pompadour*).

## P.S.

I detest folks whom, at the slightest [*rülps* ( /ˈrʏlps/ )](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%BClpsen), race for the googly interwebz on their mobiles to ascertain the "*veracity*" of statements made by their erstwhile[^1] conversation partners — woe unto ye when they cannot *detectorate* the origin what you just said, backed by explication(s) and references *statura summa*![^2] — but here I went and did it myself... kind of: I decided this was the swiftest way to get the French accented characters in that expression correct — no International US keyboard input set up on my current, antique, Linux rig, while I wait 💢 for *working modern hardware* to arrive...  Anyway, there I was, enjoying this bit of beautiful Dutch language: folks who are well versed at slightly archaic Dutch are at a severe advantage here, so sorry! 🙇 

Thank you, *Katholieke Encyclopaedie*, 1st edition, 1933-1939.[^3]

[^1]:  "*erstwhile*" as time clearly has *stopped* all around the coffee table, except for the googler himself: here's us, silently awaiting the all-important *orang mobile* action as it commences in swiped and typed *silence*, shivering in suspense, anticipating the judicial supreme verdict delivered through Sunder's elves. Oil the rope! Check the timbers and grease the trapdoor! We're holding for a jolly lynching, lo!

[^2]: It seems everyone has at least one of those in their social neighbourhood: otherwise scientific types, who apparently, *deep down at some instinctive level*, cannot fathom that less than a *pure 100%* of human knowledge is reached and presented by the search engines we all enjoy. Well, *gentlemen*, if that were so, we can *immediately halt all your research endeavours* as, clearly, there's nothing to add to the collected googlable knowledge. It's the end of the scientific era, as evidenced by your own action. Nothing more to discover. No crevice to explore, no surprise at *new* any more. *Finis*!

[^3]: Being born in an originally *protestant* crib (half atheist, half-and-a-quarter "*buitenkerkelijk*", i.e. *without affiliation to any church*, by the time I was to become an initial concept), it was, of course, *unthinkable* to own a *catholic* encyclopedia among our large number of tomes, but praise due to [archive.org](https://archive.org/search?query=Katholieke+Encyclopaedie+) and others for ensuring that one's still accessible in the 21st century. *Catholics* so *expect them to lie* 😜, but, damn, could they write! 🙇
