# The World of Data Extraction and Re-use :: PDF Reading, Annotating and Content Extraction

If you want to do more with PDFs than merely *read* them on screen^[for which there's Adobe Acrobat and if you don't like it, there's a plethora of PDF *Viewers* out there, e.g. [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader) and [FoxIt](https://www.foxit.com/).], there's trouble ahead.

It was a massive effort and presented huge technical and journalistic challenges.
