# Notes for self ([@Gerhobbelt](https://github.com/GerHobbelt))

- This whole bunch is "written while thinking" and therefor, ["*LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively*"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) applies in full force. I know. It still happens.   :-(    Need to **reorg & rewrite**.

- Who's your Target Audience? Nope, Target **Audiences**, *plural*!

  + Qiqqa Users
  
  + **Prospective** Qiqqa Users: anyone who's looking and thinking "hey, this *might* be what I'm looking for!" :thinking:
  
  + Qiqqa project members a.k.a. 'developers' (doesn't matter if you're a copy editor, software designer, bug zapper, code creator, *anyone*)
  
  + **Prospective** project members.
  
- Also need to write down: 

  + Roadmap?
  
  + Focus on X?
  
  + Follow your own mantra: give people an opportunity to learn from my mistakes. Show what went wrong or could have been done better. Decisions and decision making.
  
  + ...
