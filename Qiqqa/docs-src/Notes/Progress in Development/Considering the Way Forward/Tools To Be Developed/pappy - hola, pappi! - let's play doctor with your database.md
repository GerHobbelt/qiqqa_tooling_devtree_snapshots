# `pappy` :: Â¡HolaÂ Papi! ... Let's play doctor with your database

`pappy` = Qiqqa library and *library collective* backup + restore tool. The one you depend on when things have gotten too harsh and out of control. ðŸ˜‰
  Classical Qiqqa has these choices available at the start of the app itself, but I want everything *functional* to be situated in a *cross-platform portable*, preferably commandline driven, *back-end* set of executables, so we can carry the functionality across OS boundaries (Windows vs. Linux vs. Mac) and peruse and *test* hose with the least possible *developer cost*; the GUI then can become just "*one of many ways to access the libraries you have available*" (both at the *individual*'s and team's level).
