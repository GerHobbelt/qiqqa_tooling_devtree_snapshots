- `jackdaw` (NL: "kauwtje" (family of blackbird))  (inspired by music: Blackbird & Crow)
- `troglodytes` (birds living in caves, e.g. Dutch "winterkoninkje") -- for extra fun compare `troglodytae` ("[cave dwellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglodytae)") to `trogodytae` ([people living in Ethiopia and environs](https://oxfordre.com/classics/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-6581;jsessionid=1D13817E2D77A1285548CDFE2476E972)) --> `spelunking` --> `speleologica`
- `mela` ([Pomponius Mela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomponius_Mela) was the earliest *cartographer* whose name and output has persisted through history; many have preceded him, e.g. [Strabo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabo), and Roman legions, when traveling, measured their routes, thus producing the actual "graphing" of the world as they knew it, but none of those predecessors are referred as *cartographers*, rather *geographers*, *historians*, etc.)
* `statio`, `stationarii` (originally army barracks and their inhabitants, later the transportation management stations spread throughout the Roman Empire. See also [Stationarius (Roman military)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationarius_(Roman_military)), "[The Milites Stationarii considered in relation to the Hundred and Tithing of England](https://sci-hub.ru/10.1017/S0261340900006767)", ...)
* `nuttiyogi` (which is a contraction of Nutty Yogi Keto)
