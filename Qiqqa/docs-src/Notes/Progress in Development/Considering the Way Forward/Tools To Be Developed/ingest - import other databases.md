# `ingest` :: import other databases

`ingest` = tool to import external Qiqqa libraries, *import*/*merge* Qiqqa libraries, backups and (possibly incomplete or broken) Qiqqa metadata files + *import*/*merge* other metadata database dumps that could help us complete/improve our metadata collection, e.g. the SQL database dump for [sci-hub.ru](https://sci-hub.ru/), which carries millions of documents' metadata and file hashes (*by the look of it*). PLUS import my own rough database *dumps* and *exports*, which is another way to recover older/b0rked databases into a new Qiqqa library.
Also understand how to unpack and *ingest* `.qiqqa_backup` classical Qiqqa backup files.
