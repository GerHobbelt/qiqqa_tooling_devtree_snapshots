# single user vs. all users installer on MS Windows

The way I wish / want it, is done by the TexLive installer: run the (Nullsoft-based) installer as-is and you get a notice plus single-user install process. Run the same exe in Administrator Mode and you automatically get an All-Users install process. :+1:

The TexLive installer I mention was obtained here: https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html
