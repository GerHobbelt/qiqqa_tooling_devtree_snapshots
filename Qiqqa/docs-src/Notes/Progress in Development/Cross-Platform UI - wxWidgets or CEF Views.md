# Cross-Platform UI: wxWidgets or CEF Views?

*New Qiqqa* must come with a cross-platform UI, which supports Windows, Linux and Mac.

We have been looking at using wxWidgets + WebView (wxWidgets+CEF is unsupported and hairy).

Not much trouble, except we'ld be using different browser engines for our UI in different platforms, potentially causing issues with our web-technologies based UI.

The alternative, that's been in the picture since we started looking at CEF, is CEF Views, plus a bare metal minimal wrapper for each platform.

*That* means we'ld have a (slightly) different codebase for each platform, which is where wxWindows pops up as a we-covered-that-hassle -- while it comes itself with the afore-mentioned issue of using different engines on different platforms to render the UI HTML.

The [Cross Platform GUI Trainwreck article](https://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/05/29/cross-platform-gui-toolkit-trainwreck-2016-edition/) puts it succinctly: whatever you choose, you're SOL (and out of karma).

While I might still dither a bit between bare-metal minimal native + CEF vs. wxWindows+WebView for my UI and Qiqqa Sniffer/Browser needs, I've come to the conclusion that the rest is cute in all their own ways, but not fit for me and my purposes & preferences.

While [Trainwreck](https://blog.johnnovak.net/2016/05/29/cross-platform-gui-toolkit-trainwreck-2016-edition/) dates back to 2016, here's [another daring soul from 2019 AD](https://www.hohlerde.org/rauch/en/blog/2019-12-08-GUI-Frameworks/) taking a stab at it. He goes for Qt in the end, with some grumbling. I myself am not fond of Qt at all, so I'll stick with wxWindows then? However, UI flickering is mentioned and [a link to the wxWiki provided](https://wiki.wxwidgets.org/Flicker-Free_Drawing) where this is discussed more in-depth.
From the noises there I gather *wx* doesn't suffer from that issue anymore, or very little, in 2021AD... something to (re-)check myself soon!



### So whatchammagonnado?

*\<sarcasm\>* Revert to one of my oldest friends of yonder days: [TVision?](https://github.com/magiblot/tvision) **Now *that* is what I'ld call *cool* and *totally RETRO*. Utterly!**  :+1: *\</sarcasm\>*

> But should we redo Qiqqa UI in that one? *Come on*...
