# PDF bulktest + mutool_ex PDF + URL tests: logbook notes


# Test run notes at the bleeding edge

This is about the multiple test runs covering the `evil-base` PDF corpus: I've been collecting these notes over the years. **Big Caveat: these notes were valid at the time of writing, but MAY be obsolete or even contradicting current behaviour at any later moment, sometimes even *seconds* away from the original event.**

This is about the things we observe when applying our tools at the bleeding edge of development to existing PDFs of all sorts, plus more or less wicked Internet URLs we checked out and the (grave) bugs that pop up most unexpectedly.

This is the lump sum notes (logbook) of these test runs' *odd observations*.

(The logbook was started quite a while ago, back in 2020.)
