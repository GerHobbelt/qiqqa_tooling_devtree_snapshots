# PDF download URLs with problems
(**TODO**: merge with [[Testing - Nasty URLs for PDFs]]?)

**Note**: it's quite usual for MSEdge/Chrome to fail to display/load/download a PDF when it's from a site with an expired certificate. Do note that this is observed almost always when Chrome is already pretty loaded with PDF-displaying tabs.

**Note**: Chrome/MSEdge do display PDFs nicely, but apparently are not geared towards showing them in multiple tabs: when you have several open, thanks to, for example, a quick search-and-open-interesting-links-in-new-tab activity, then a *lot* of the PDFs will not be shown and instead the gray background is shown plus a small print text: "Couldn't load plugin." --> This suggests we should make sure we'll be displaying every PDF in the Qiqqa native viewer or user-selected viewer instead, if at all possible, as this kind of usage of the (embedded) browser will certainly get us into trouble (user bug reports...)
