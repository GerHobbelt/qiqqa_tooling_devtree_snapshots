# NTFS ADS Data Viewer & Zone3 Data Gatherer

## Purpose

Many PDFs have, when downloaded from the Internet using Chrome or MSIE/Edge, an extra "stream" attached to them, which is hidden to the user, but part of the file.

This includes so-called "Zone3" information, which includes the URL where the PDF was downloaded.

Now *that* info is very handy to add as metadata in Qiqqa when we can obtain that info, for that would nicely augment the metadata with sourceing infom, even when the user did *not* use the Qiqqa Sniffer to fetch that PDF.

This data is specific to these browsers (Google's and MS) and Windows + NTFS and some very specific actions must be performed to get at such data.


(TODO: add link to explanation of Zone3 etc. on the Net.)

## Motto

This here is part of the technical storyboarding side of a UI & UX overhaul of Qiqqa.

Before we put it to Qiqqa, it will be tested here.
