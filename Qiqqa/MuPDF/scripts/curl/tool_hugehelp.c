"to pass on your own custom headers when getting a web page. You can do\n"
"this by using the `-H` flag.\n"

"## FTP and Firewalls\n"
"\n"
"The FTP protocol requires one of the involved parties to open a second\n"
"connection as soon as data is about to get transferred. There are two ways to\n"
"do this.\n"
"\n"
"The default way for curl is to issue the PASV command which causes the server\n"
"to open another port and await another connection performed by the\n"
"client. This is good if the client is behind a firewall that doesn't allow\n"
"incoming connections.\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"    curl ftp.download.com\n"
"\n"
"If the server, for example, is behind a firewall that doesn't allow\n"
"connections on ports other than 21 (or if it just doesn't support the `PASV`\n"
"command), the other way to do it is to use the `PORT` command and instruct the\n"
"server to connect to the client on the given IP number and port (as parameters\n"
"to the PORT command).\n"
"\n"
"The `-P` flag to curl supports a few different options. Your machine may have\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"several IP-addresses and/or network interfaces and curl allows you to select\n"
"which of them to use. Default address can also be used:\n"

"    curl -P - ftp.download.com\n"
"\n"
"Download with `PORT` but use the IP address of our `le0` interface (this does\n"
"not work on windows):\n"

"Download with `PORT` but use 192.168.0.10 as our IP address to use:\n"

"## HTTPS\n"
"\n"
"Secure HTTP requires a TLS library to be installed and used when curl is\n"
"built. If that is done, curl is capable of retrieving and posting documents\n"
"using the HTTPS protocol.\n"
"\n"
"Example:\n"
"\n"
"    curl https://www.secure-site.com\n"
"\n"
"that require valid certificates. The only drawback is that the certificate\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"needs to be in PEM-format. PEM is a standard and open format to store\n"
"certificates with, but it is not used by the most commonly used browsers. If\n"
"you want curl to use the certificates you use with your (favourite) browser,\n"
"you may need to download/compile a converter that can convert your browser's\n"

"personal password:\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"    curl -E /path/to/cert.pem:password https://secure.site.com/\n"
"\n"
"If you neglect to specify the password on the command line, you will be\n"
"prompted for the correct password before any data can be received.\n"
"\n"
"Many older HTTPS servers have problems with specific SSL or TLS versions,\n"
"which newer versions of OpenSSL etc use, therefore it is sometimes useful to\n"
"specify what SSL-version curl should use. Use -3, -2 or -1 to specify that\n"
"exact SSL version to use (for SSLv3, SSLv2 or TLSv1 respectively):\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"    curl -2 https://secure.site.com/\n"
"\n"
"Otherwise, curl will attempt to use a sensible TLS default version.\n"
"\n"
"## Resuming File Transfers\n"
"\n"
"To continue a file transfer where it was previously aborted, curl supports\n"
"resume on HTTP(S) downloads as well as FTP uploads and downloads.\n"
"\n"
"Continue downloading a document:\n"
"\n"
"    curl -C - -o file ftp://ftp.server.com/path/file\n"

"Continue downloading a document from a web server\n"
"\n"
"    curl -C - -o file http://www.server.com/\n"
"\n"
"## Time Conditions\n"
"\n"
"HTTP allows a client to specify a time condition for the document it requests.\n"
"It is `If-Modified-Since` or `If-Unmodified-Since`. curl allows you to specify\n"
"them with the `-z`/`--time-cond` flag.\n"
"\n"
"For example, you can easily make a download that only gets performed if the\n"
"remote file is newer than a local copy. It would be made like:\n"
"\n"
, stdout);
 fputs(
"    curl -z local.html http://remote.server.com/remote.html\n"
"\n"
"Or you can download a file only if the local file is newer than the remote\n"
"one. Do this by prepending the date string with a `-`, as in:\n"
"\n"
"    curl -z -local.html http://remote.server.com/remote.html\n"
"\n"
"You can specify a \"free text\" date as condition. Tell curl to only download\n"
"the file if it was updated since January 12, 2012:\n"
"\n"
"    curl -z \"Jan 12 2012\" http://remote.server.com/remote.html\n"

"## Netrc\n"
"\n"
"Unix introduced the `.netrc` concept a long time ago. It is a way for a user\n"
"to specify name and password for commonly visited FTP sites in a file so that\n"
"you don't have to type them in each time you visit those sites. You realize\n"
"this is a big security risk if someone else gets hold of your passwords, so\n"

"therefore most unix programs won't read this file unless it is only readable\n"
"by yourself (curl doesn't care though).\n"

"use it for all protocols where authentication is used.\n"

"## TELNET\n"
"\n"
"The curl telnet support is basic and very easy to use. Curl passes all data\n"
"passed to it on stdin to the remote server. Connect to a remote telnet server\n"
"using a command line similar to:\n"
"\n"
"    curl telnet://remote.server.com\n"

"Pass options to the telnet protocol negotiation, by using the `-t` option. To\n"

"track when the login prompt is received and send the username and password\n"
"accordingly.\n"
"\n"

"## Multiple Transfers With A Single Command Line\n"
"\n"
"As is mentioned above, you can download multiple files with one command line\n"
