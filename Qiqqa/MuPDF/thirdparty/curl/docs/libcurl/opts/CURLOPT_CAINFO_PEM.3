.TH CURLOPT_CAINFO_PEM 3 "14 Nov 2020" "libcurl 7.74.0" "curl_easy_setopt options"
.SH NAME
CURLOPT_CAINFO \- with proxy Certificate Authority (CA) bundle in PEM format
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curl/curl.h>

CURLcode curl_easy_setopt(CURL *handle, CURLOPT_CAINFO_PEM, char *pem_string);
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pass a char * to a null-terminated string with PEM encoded content holding one
or more certificates to verify the HTTPS proxy with.

If \fICURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER(3)\fP is zero and you avoid verifying the
server's certificate, \fICURLOPT_CAINFO(3)\fP need not even indicate an
accessible file.


The application does not have to keep the string around after setting this
option.
.SH DEFAULT
Built-in system specific. When curl is built with Secure Transport or
Schannel, this option is not set by default.
.SH PROTOCOLS
All TLS based protocols: HTTPS, FTPS, IMAPS, POP3S, SMTPS etc.
.SH EXAMPLE
.nf
const char* strpem;
/* user must fill strpem with content of a PEM file */
CURL *curl = curl_easy_init();
if(curl) {
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_URL, "https://example.com/");
  curl_easy_setopt(curl, CURLOPT_CAINFO_PEM, strpem);
  ret = curl_easy_perform(curl);
  curl_easy_cleanup(curl);
}
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
Added in 7.74.0

This option is supported by the OpenSSL backends.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns CURLE_OK if the option is supported, CURLE_UNKNOWN_OPTION if not, or
CURLE_OUT_OF_MEMORY if there was insufficient heap space.
