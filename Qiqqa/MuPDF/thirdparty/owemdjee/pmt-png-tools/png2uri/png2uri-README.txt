 png2uri is a command-line application that creates an HTML "img" tag on
 standard output containing a data URI, from a PNG file or from standard
 input. Other formats besides the default, PNG, are supported, via the "-f"
 or "--format" option or, if that option was not supplied, by inspection of
 the filename extension.

 Usage: png2uri [-f format|--format format] [-u|--uri_only] [infile [outfile]]

        options: -f|--format TYPE: 
                 write "image/TYPE" instead of "image/png" in the
                 data uri.  TYPE can be png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, or gif,
                 or any of those in upper case.  To write any other
                 type, include the complete MIME type as in
                 "--format image/x-jng" or "-f audio/mpeg".

                 -u|--uri_only|--url_only
                 omit the surrounding "img" tag and only write the
                 data URI.

 Requires /bin/sh and a base64(1) that encodes its input in base64
 according to RFC-3548 and writes the result on standard output, and
 a working "sed".  Versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.3 used uuencode(1) instead
 of base64(), but a surprising number of machines that I've tried
 (5 out of 11) don't have uuencode installed, while all 11 had base64(1)
 which is a "core utility" rather than a "shar utility".  Using base64()
 has an additional advantage that the lines are always folded to the same
 width, 76 characters wide, while uuencode sometimes writes shorter lines.

 OTHER IMPLEMENTATIONS

 If you prefer a web-based converter or a java application, this isn't
 it. Use your search engine and look for "png data uri" to find one.

 CHANGE LOG

   Version 1.0.0, July 3, 2012:

      Initial release.

   Version 1.0.1, July 4, 2012:

      The string "base64" could conceivably appear within the encoded data
      and any line containing "base64" is removed; revised script to
      use "====" instead to remove the first line of uuencode output.

      Implemented "-u" and "--url_only" option.

   Version 1.0.2, July 4, 2012:

      Implemented "-f TYPE" and "--format TYPE" option.

   Version 1.0.3, July 5, 2012:

      Changed environment variable "format" to PNG2URI_FMT reduce possibility`
      of name conflict, and changed "uri_only" to PNG2URI_URI.  Fixed some
      indentation.

   Version 1.0.4, July 6, 2012:

      Use "base64" instead of "uuencode" when "uname" returns "Linux" to
      generate the output, because "base64" seems to be more prevalently
      available. On Gnu/Linux platforms, uuencode must be installed as part
      of "sharutils", which often doesnn't happen.  SunOS and FreeBSD don't
      supply "base64" so we use "uuencode" instead.

   Version 1.0.5, July 7, 2012:

      Eliminated use of "uname" and use the return of "base64" and "uuencode"
      to select the workable one (checking "base64" first); suggested by
      John Bowler.  Added a check for too many arguments, also a JB suggestion.
      Accept output filename as an optional final argument.

   Version 1.0.6, July 7, 2012:

      Removed an unnecessary "2> /dev/null" from the uuencode command, which
      was hiding the error report when both "base64" nd "uuencode" fail within
      the png2uri_encode function, as when attempting a run under MSYS.
      Added "&&" after the echo commands to be sure that any error return
      is displayed.

 TO DO

 1. Test on various other platforms. I assume we'll soon find one that has
    neither "uuencode" nor "base64".  The following have been tried and
    succeed:

    Ubuntu 10.04 (using "base64")
    Ubuntu 12.04 (using "base64")
    SunOS 5.10   (using "uuencode")
    SunOS 5.11   (using "uuencode")
    FreeBSD 8.0  (using "uuencode")
    Redhat Gnu/Linux (using "base64")
    Redhat Enterprise (using "base64")
    Cywin
    Gentoo-linux
    OpenBSD

    The following fail:

    MSYS

 2. Find out if the script works on Windows and Mac or can be modified to
 do so.

 3. Make it work as a drag-and-drop application.

 4. But keep it simple!
