  This is the pngzop branch of the "pmt" tree.
  Code for supporting the "zopfli" compression method
  in PNG files will appear here.

  Eventually this collection of scripts might be incorporated
  into pngcrush.

  license plus UCITA disclaimers). See DISCLAIMERS and LICENSE below.

  Usage:
  pngzop [-b|--blacken] [-d|--directory dir] [-e|--extension ext] *.png

  Input: *.png
  Output (default): *_pngzop.png (to overwrite the input, use "-e .png")

  Pngzop does the following:

    1. Preprocesses the input file(s) with pngcrush -reduce
       (and optionally -blacken to clean up "dirty" transparent pixels)

    2. Uses pngcrush to write 6 test files, with 5 PNG filters and adaptive
       filtering.

    3. Extracts the IDAT contents from each of the 6 files.

    4. Recompresses the IDAT contents with zopfli (25 iterations).

    5. Reassembles the PNG file using the smallest of the zopfli-compressed
       results.

    6. Postprocesses the PNG file with "pngfix" to optimize the windowBits
       field, to minimize memory use during later decompression.

  Pngzop requires zopfli, pngcrush (version 1.7.66 or later), zpipe (from
  the "examples" directory of the zlib-1.2.7 or later distribution),
  pngfix (from the libpng-1.6.3 or later distribution), and "mkdir -p",
  along with these programs that should have been installed from their "C"
  sources along with this "pngzop" script:
 
         pngzop_get_ihdr.exe
         pngzop_get_idat.exe
         pngzop_get_iend.exe
         pngzop_zlib_to_idat.exe
