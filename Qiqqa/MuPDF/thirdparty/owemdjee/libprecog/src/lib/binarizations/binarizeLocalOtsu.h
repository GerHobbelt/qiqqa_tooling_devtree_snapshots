 * \brief Implementation of local Otsu binarization algorithm.
 * \param inputImage Image for binarization.
 * \param outputImage Resulting image.
 * \param maxValue New value for pixel which intensity greater than threshold value.
 * \param CLAHEClipLimit Parameter for CLAHE procedure.
 * \param GaussianBlurKernelSize Parameter for Gaussian blur procedure.
 * \param CannyUpperThresholdCoeff Coefficient for upper threshold of Canny edge detector.
 * \param CannyLowerThresholdCoeff Coefficient for lower threshold of Canny edge detector.
 * \param CannyMorphIters Parameter of morphology operations.
 * \details This function consists of next steps:
 * -# Histogram enchanting by CLAHE.
 * -# Edges detection by Canny.
 * -# Morphology operations.
 * -# Contours detection.
 * -# Binarization by Otsu of bounding rectangle of each contour.
