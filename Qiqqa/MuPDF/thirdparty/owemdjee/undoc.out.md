<img src="doc/jxl.svg" width="100" align="right" alt="JXL logo">

This repository contains a reference implementation of JPEG XL (encoder and
decoder), called `libjxl`. This software library is
[used by many applications that support JPEG XL](doc/software_support.md).

JPEG XL was standardized in 2022 as [ISO/IEC 18181](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/workplan.html).
The [core codestream](doc/format_overview.md#codestream-features) is specified in 18181-1,
the [file format](doc/format_overview.md#file-format-features) in 18181-2.
[Decoder conformance](https://github.com/libjxl/conformance) is defined in 18181-3,
and 18181-4 is the [reference software](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl).

The library API, command line options, and tools in this repository are subject
to change, however files encoded with `cjxl` conform to the JPEG XL specification
and can be decoded with current and future `djxl` decoders or the `libjxl` decoding library.

## Installation

In most Linux distributions, installing `libjxl` is just a matter of using the package management system.
For example in Debian-based distributions: `apt install libjxl-tools` will install `cjxl` and `djxl`
and other tools like `benchmark_xl` are available in the package `libjxl-devtools`.
On MacOS, you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install jpeg-xl`.

[![libjxl packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/libjxl.svg?exclude_unsupported=1&columns=3&exclude_sources=modules,site&header=libjxl%20packaging%20status)](https://repology.org/project/libjxl/versions)


For Windows, binaries can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/releases/).

Of course you can also [build libjxl from sources](BUILDING.md).


## Usage

To encode a source image to JPEG XL with default settings:

```bash
cjxl input.png output.jxl
```

The desired visual fidelity can be selected using the `--distance` parameter
(in units of just-noticeable difference, where 0 is lossless and the most useful lossy range is 0.5 .. 3.0),
or using `--quality` (on a scale from 0 to 100, roughly matching libjpeg).
The [encode effort](doc/encode_effort.md) can be selected using the `--effort` parameter.

For more settings run `cjxl --help` or for a full list of options
run `cjxl -v -v --help`.

To decode a JPEG XL file run:

```bash
djxl input.jxl output.png
```

When possible `cjxl`/`djxl` are able to read/write the following
image formats: .exr, .gif, .jpeg/.jpg, .pfm, .pgm/.ppm, .pgx, .png.
Specifically for JPEG files, the default `cjxl` behavior is to apply lossless
recompression and the default `djxl` behavior is to reconstruct the original
JPEG file (when the extension of the output file is .jpg).

### Benchmarking

For speed benchmarks on single images in single or multi-threaded decoding
`djxl` can print decoding speed information. See `djxl --help` for details
on the decoding options and note that the output image is optional for
benchmarking purposes.

For more comprehensive benchmarking options, see the
[benchmarking guide](doc/benchmarking.md).

### Library API

Besides the `libjxl` library [API documentation](https://libjxl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),
there are [example applications](examples/) and [plugins](plugins/) that can be used as a reference or
starting point for developers who wish to integrate `libjxl` in their project.

Jpeginfo v1.7.0beta  Copyright (c) 1995-2023, Timo Kokkonen.


REQUIREMENTS
	jpeglib, Independent JPEG Group's jpeg library version 6a or
        version 7 (or later version)

TESTED PLATFORMS
	Linux
	MacOS
	Solaris
        IRIX
	HP-UX

INSTALLATION
	Installation should be very straightforward, just unpack the
	tar file, run configure script, and then compile the program. 
	You may wanna do something like this:

		gunzip -c jpeginfo-1.7.0.tar.gz | tar xf -
		cd jpeginfo-1.7.0
		./configure
		make
		make strip
		make install

	NOTE! if 'configure' cannot find libjpeg.a or jpeglib.h, then
	you must use the --with-jpeglib option when running configure,
	see 'configure --help'.


HISTORY
        v1.7.0 - add support for reading input file stdin,
	         other minor fixes.
	v1.6.2 - add SHA256 digest support (--sha256 or -2),
	         improved Win32 support thanks to tumagonx,
		 other minor fixes.
	v1.6.1 - support for new libjpeg v7 thanks to Guido Vollbeding,
		 fix to display of 8bit characters by Pierre Jarillon
	v1.6.0 - added support for printing out Comments (from COM
	         markers), Exif format images are now also recognized
	         (no Exif marker decoding functionality, though).
	v1.5   - configuration is now done with GNU autoconf, 
		 program now uses free MD5 algorithm,
		 added file size as new field on reports,
		 program now returns exit code 1 if one or more of the jpegs
		 had any errors, useful for testing if particular jpeg is
	         ok from shell scripts, 
	         also if you specify -q (--quiet) option twice on
		 command line, then program won't produce any output.
	v1.4   - added support for calculating MD5 checksums.
	v1.3   - alternative listing format (-l switch) added.
	         new column on reports displaying whether jpeg is

	         new switch -f for passing filenames to program from
	         file or stdin.
	v1.2   - improved support for other platforms, minor fixes
        v1.1.2 - small fixes, improvements to Makefile
	v1.1   - modified to use Independent JPEG Group's new v.6a library,

# libdivide
[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/ridiculousfish/libdivide?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kimwalisch/libdivide)
[![Github Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/ridiculousfish/libdivide.svg)](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide/releases)

```libdivide.h```  is a header-only C/C++ library for optimizing integer division.
Integer division is one of the slowest instructions on most CPUs e.g. on
current x64 CPUs a 64-bit integer division has a latency of up to 90 clock
cycles whereas a multiplication has a latency of only 3 clock cycles.
libdivide allows you to replace expensive integer divsion instructions by
a sequence of shift, add and multiply instructions that will calculate
the integer division much faster.

On current CPUs you can get a **speedup of up to 10x** for 64-bit integer division
and a speedup of up to to 5x for 32-bit integer division when using libdivide.
libdivide also supports [SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2),
[AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) and
[AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions)
vector division which provides an even larger speedup. You can test how much
speedup you can achieve on your CPU using the [benchmark](#benchmark-program)
program.

libdivide is compatible with 8-bit microcontrollers, such as the AVR series: [the CI build includes a AtMega2560 target](test/avr/readme.md). Since low end hardware such as this often do not include a hardware divider, libdivide is particulary useful. In addition to the runtime [C](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide/blob/master/doc/C-API.md) & [C++](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide/blob/master/doc/CPP-API.md) APIs, a set of [predefined macros](constant_fast_div.h) and [templates](constant_fast_div.hpp) is included to speed up division by 16-bit constants: division by a 16-bit constant is [not optimized by avr-gcc on 8-bit systems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47994933/why-doesnt-gcc-or-clang-on-arm-use-division-by-invariant-integers-using-multip). 

See https://libdivide.com for more information on libdivide.

# C++ example

The first code snippet divides all integers in a vector using integer division.
This is slow as integer division is at least one order of magnitude slower than
any other integer arithmetic operation on current CPUs.

```C++
void divide(std::vector<int64_t>& vect, int64_t divisor)
{
    // Slow, uses integer division
    for (auto& n : vect)
        n /= divisor;
}
```

The second code snippet runs much faster, it uses libdivide to compute the
integer division using a sequence of shift, add and multiply instructions hence
avoiding the slow integer divison operation.

```C++
#include "libdivide.h"

void divide(std::vector<int64_t>& vect, int64_t divisor)
{
    libdivide::divider<int64_t> fast_d(divisor);

    // Fast, computes division using libdivide
    for (auto& n : vect)
        n /= fast_d;
}
```

Generally libdivide will give at significant speedup if:

* The divisor is only known at runtime
* The divisor is reused multiple times e.g. in a loop

# C example

You first need to generate a libdivide divider using one of the ```libdivide_*_gen``` functions (```*```:&nbsp;```s32```,&nbsp;```u32```,&nbsp;```s64```,&nbsp;```u64```)
which can then be used to compute the actual integer division using the
corresponding ```libdivide_*_do``` function.

```C
#include "libdivide.h"

void divide(int64_t *array, size_t size, int64_t divisor)
{
    struct libdivide_s64_t fast_d = libdivide_s64_gen(divisor);

    // Fast, computes division using libdivide
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i++)
        array[i] = libdivide_s64_do(array[i], &fast_d);
}
```

# Branchfull vs branchfree

The default libdivide divider makes use of
[branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_(computer_science)) to compute the integer
division. When the same divider is used inside a hot loop as in the C++ example section the
CPU will accurately predict the branches and there will be no performance slowdown. Often
the compiler is even able to move the branches outside the body of the loop hence
completely eliminating the branches, this is called loop-invariant code motion.

libdivide also has a branchfree divider type which computes the integer division without
using any branch instructions. The branchfree divider generally uses a few more instructions
than the default branchfull divider. The main use case for the branchfree divider is when
you have an array of different divisors and you need to iterate over the divisors. In this
case the default branchfull divider would exhibit poor performance as the CPU won't be
able to correctly predict the branches.

```C++
#include "libdivide.h"

// 64-bit branchfree divider type
using branchfree_t = libdivide::branchfree_divider<uint64_t>;

uint64_t divide(uint64_t x, std::vector<branchfree_t>& vect)
{
    uint64_t sum = 0;

    for (auto& fast_d : vect)
        sum += x / fast_d;

    return sum;
}
```

Caveats of branchfree divider:

* Unsigned branchfree divider cannot be ```1```
* Faster for unsigned types than for signed types

# Vector division

libdivide supports [SSE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE2),
[AVX2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) and
[AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions)
vector division on x86 and x64 CPUs. In the example below we divide the packed 32-bit
integers inside an AVX512 vector using libdivide. libdivide supports 32-bit and 64-bit
vector division for both signed and unsigned integers.

```C++
#include "libdivide.h"

void divide(std::vector<__m512i>& vect, uint32_t divisor)
{
    libdivide::divider<uint32_t> fast_d(divisor);

    // AVX512 vector division
    for (auto& n : vect)
        n /= fast_d;
}
```

Note that you need to define one of macros below to enable vector division:

* ```LIBDIVIDE_SSE2```
* ```LIBDIVIDE_AVX2```
* ```LIBDIVIDE_AVX512```
* ```LIBDIVIDE_NEON```

# Performance tips

* If possible use unsigned integer types because libdivide's unsigned division is measurably
  faster than its signed division. This is especially true for the branchfree divider.
* Try both the default branchfull divider and the branchfree divider in your program and
  choose the one that performs best. The branchfree divider is more likely to get auto
  vectorized by the compiler (if you compile with e.g. ```-march=native```). But don't forget
  that the unsigned branchfree divider cannot be 1.
* Vector division is much faster for 32-bit than for 64-bit. This is because there are
  currently no vector multiplication instructions on x86 to efficiently calculate
  64-bit * 64-bit to 128-bit. 

# Build instructions

libdivide has one test program and two benchmark programs which can be built using cmake and
a recent C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Optionally ```libdivide.h``` can also be
installed to ```/usr/local/include```.

```bash
cmake .
make -j
sudo make install
```

# Tester program

You can pass the **tester** program one or more of the following arguments: ```u32```,
```s32```, ```u64```, ```s64``` to test the four cases (signed, unsigned, 32-bit, or 64-bit), or
run it with no arguments to test all four. The tester will verify the correctness of libdivide
via a set of randomly chosen numerators and denominators, by comparing the result of libdivide's
division to hardware division. It will stop with an error message as soon as it finds a
discrepancy.

# Benchmark program

You can pass the **benchmark** program one or more of the following arguments: ```u16```, ```s16```, ```u32```,
```s32```, ```u64```, ```s64``` to compare libdivide's speed against hardware division.
**benchmark** tests a simple function that inputs an array of random numerators and a single
divisor, and returns the sum of their quotients. It tests this using both hardware division, and
the various division approaches supported by libdivide, including vector division.

It will output data like this:

```bash
 #   system  scalar  scl_bf  vector  vec_bf   gener   algo
 1   9.684   0.792   0.783   0.426   0.426    1.346   0
 2   9.078   0.781   1.609   0.426   1.529    1.346   0
 3   9.078   1.355   1.609   1.334   1.531   29.045   1
 4   9.076   0.787   1.609   0.426   1.529    1.346   0
 5   9.074   1.349   1.609   1.334   1.531   29.045   1
 6   9.078   1.349   1.609   1.334   1.531   29.045   1
...
```

It will keep going as long as you let it, so it's best to stop it when you are happy with the
denominators tested. These columns have the following significance. All times are in
nanoseconds, lower is better.

```
     #:  The divisor that is tested
system:  Hardware divide time
scalar:  libdivide time, using scalar division
scl_bf:  libdivide time, using scalar branchfree division
vector:  libdivide time, using vector division
vec_bf:  libdivide time, using vector branchfree division
 gener:  Time taken to generate the divider struct
  algo:  The algorithm used.
```

The **benchmark** program will also verify that each function returns the same value,
so benchmark is valuable for its verification as well.

# Contributing

Although there are no individual unit tests, the supplied ```cmake``` builds do include several safety nets:

* They compile with:
  * All warnings on and;
  * Warnings as errors
* The CI build will build and run with sanitizers on ; these are available as part of the cmake build: ```-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Sanitize```
* The ```cmake``` and CI builds will compile and run both ```C``` and ```C++``` test programs.

Before sending in patches, build and run at least the ```tester``` and ```benchmark``` using the supplied ```cmake``` scripts on at least ```MSVC``` and ```GCC``` (or ```Clang```).

### Happy hacking!

README for libpng version 1.6.40.git
====================================

See the note about version numbers near the top of `png.h`.
See `INSTALL` for instructions on how to install libpng.

Libpng comes in several distribution formats.  Get `libpng-*.tar.gz`
or `libpng-*.tar.xz` if you want UNIX-style line endings in the text
files, or `lpng*.7z` or `lpng*.zip` if you want DOS-style line endings.

For a detailed description on using libpng, read `libpng-manual.txt`.
For examples of libpng in a program, see `example.c` and `pngtest.c`.
For usage information and restrictions (what little they are) on libpng,
see `png.h`.  For a description on using zlib (the compression library
used by libpng) and zlib's restrictions, see `zlib.h`.

You should use zlib 1.0.4 or later to run this, but it _may_ work with
versions as old as zlib 0.95.  Even so, there are bugs in older zlib
versions which can cause the output of invalid compression streams for
some images.

You should also note that zlib is a compression library that is useful
for more things than just PNG files.  You can use zlib as a drop-in
replacement for `fread()` and `fwrite()`, if you are so inclined.

zlib should be available at the same place that libpng is, or at
https://zlib.net .

You may also want a copy of the PNG specification.  It is available
as an RFC, a W3C Recommendation, and an ISO/IEC Standard.  You can find
these at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngdocs.html .

This code is currently being archived at https://libpng.sourceforge.io
in the download area, and at http://libpng.download/src .

This release, based in a large way on Glenn's, Guy's and Andreas'
earlier work, was created and will be supported by myself and the PNG
development group.

Historical notes
----------------

The libpng library has been in extensive use and testing since mid-1995.
Version 0.89, published a year later, was the first official release.
By late 1997, it had finally gotten to the stage where there hadn't
been significant changes to the API in some time, and people have a bad
feeling about libraries with versions below 1.0.  Version 1.0.0 was
released in March 1998.

Note that some of the changes to the `png_info` structure render this
version of the library binary incompatible with libpng-0.89 or
earlier versions if you are using a shared library.  The type of the
`filler` parameter for `png_set_filler()` has changed from `png_byte`
to `png_uint_32`, which will affect shared-library applications that
use this function.

To avoid problems with changes to the internals of the `info_struct`,
new APIs have been made available in 0.95 to avoid direct application
access to `info_ptr`.  These functions are the `png_set_<chunk>` and
`png_get_<chunk>` functions.  These functions should be used when
accessing/storing the `info_struct` data, rather than manipulating it
directly, to avoid such problems in the future.

It is important to note that the APIs did not make current programs
that access the info struct directly incompatible with the new
library, through libpng-1.2.x.  In libpng-1.4.x, which was meant to
be a transitional release, members of the `png_struct` and the
`info_struct` can still be accessed, but the compiler will issue a
warning about deprecated usage.  Since libpng-1.5.0, direct access
to these structs is not allowed, and the definitions of the structs
reside in private `pngstruct.h` and `pnginfo.h` header files that are
not accessible to applications.  It is strongly suggested that new
programs use the new APIs (as shown in `example.c` and `pngtest.c`),
and older programs be converted to the new format, to facilitate
upgrades in the future.

The additions since 0.89 include the ability to read from a PNG stream
which has had some (or all) of the signature bytes read by the calling
application.  This also allows the reading of embedded PNG streams that
do not have the PNG file signature.  As well, it is now possible to set
the library action on the detection of chunk CRC errors.  It is possible
to set different actions based on whether the CRC error occurred in a
critical or an ancillary chunk.

The additions since 0.90 include the ability to compile libpng as a
Windows DLL, and new APIs for accessing data in the `info_struct`.
Experimental functions included the ability to set weighting and cost
factors for row filter selection, direct reads of integers from buffers
on big-endian processors that support misaligned data access, faster
methods of doing alpha composition, and more accurate 16-to-8 bit color
conversion.  Some of these experimental functions, such as the weighted
filter heuristics, have since been removed.

- **XMP-Toolkit-SDK** [üìÅ](./XMP-Toolkit-SDK) [üåê](https://github.com/GerHobbelt/XMP-Toolkit-SDK)

# XMP-Toolkit-SDK fork used by [Diffractor](https://diffractor.com/)

Few changes from the original:
- added vcxproj file 
- POPM (rating) and TPE2 (albumArtist) reconciliations for MP3
- windows tag support and other fixes from chebum
- tweaks for C++ 17
- WEBP support from [Exempi](https://libopenraw.freedesktop.org/exempi/)

# XMP-Toolkit-SDK

The XMP Toolkit allows you to integrate XMP functionality into your product or solution. It supports Macintosh, Windows, as well as UNIX and comes with samples, documentation, source code and scripts to generate project files. The XMP Toolkit is available under the BSD license. The specification is provided under the [XMP Specification Public Patent License](https://wwwimages2.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/xmp/pdfs/cs6/xmp_public_patent_license.pdf)


## SDK components

The XMP Toolkit SDK contains two libraries, XMPCore and XMPFiles. XMPCore and XMPFiles are provided as C++ implementations.


### XMPCore

This library supplies an API for parsing, manipulating, and serializing metadata, according to the XMP data model and regardless of the file format of the data it describes.


### XMPFiles

This library supplies an API for locating, adding, or updating the XMP metadata in a file. The API allows you to retrieve the entire XMP Packet, which you can then pass to the XMPCore component in order to manipulate the individual XMP properties.

*It also includes a plug-in SDK that allows you to create an XMPFiles Plug-in that handles metadata for additional file formats, or replaces built-in format handlers with custom ones.*


## XMP Toolkit SDK Contents

This git repo contains the following folders under the root folder:

Directory | Details 
------------ | -------------
/ 				| At the root level, the license agreement (BSD_License.txt) and this overview (XMP-Toolkit-SDK-Overview.pdf).
build/ 			| Contains Batch file, shell scripts, Makefile and CMake scripts to be used to create XMP Toolkit SDK project files on the supported platforms. Follow the instructions in README.txt to create the projects.
docs/ 			| The three-part XMP Specification, the XMP Toolkit SDK Programmer‚Äôs Guide, the API reference documentation (API/index.html) and the XMPFiles plug-in SDK documentation.
public/include/ | The header files and glue code that clients of the XMP Toolkit SDK must include.
samples/ 		| Sample source code and CMake scripts for building sample projects, with the necessary resources to run the sample code. See ‚Äò‚ÄòSample code and tools‚Äô‚Äô below.
source/ 		| The common source code that is used by both components of the XMP Toolkit SDK.
XMPCore/ 		| The source code for XMPCore library.
XMPFiles/ 		| The source code for XMPFiles library.
third-party/ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expat/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zlib/<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zuid/	| Placeholders for third party source files which are needed for the XMP Toolkit SDK, including ReadMe.txt files with information on how to obtain and install the tools. MD5 source code, needed by both components for MD5 hash computation, is included.
tools/ 			| Placeholder for downloading and placing CMake tool
XMPFilesPlugins/| The header files and glue code of the XMPFiles plug-in SDK and a sample plug-in.


## How to Build and Use

XMP Toolkit SDK provides build script to ease the process. This repository contains everything needed to build SDK libraries on Mac OS¬Æ, Windows¬Æ, UNIX¬Æ/Linux¬Æ, iOS and Android. For detailed build steps , refer the [Programmer's Guide](https://github.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK/blob/master/docs/XMPProgrammersGuide.pdf)


## Documentation

See extensive [API documentation](https://github.com/adobe/XMP-Toolkit-SDK/blob/master/docs/XMPProgrammersGuide.pdf) where a complete API Reference is available.

The XMP Specification, available from [Adobe Developer Center (XMP)](http://adobe.com/devnet/xmp/), provides a complete formal
specification for XMP. Before working with the XMP Toolkit SDK, you must be familiar with, at a minimum,
the XMP Data Model.

The specification has three parts:
- Part 1, Data Model, Serialization, and Core Properties covers the basic metadata representation model
that is the foundation of the XMP standard format. The Data Model prescribes how XMP metadata can
be organized; it is independent of file format or specific usage. The Serialization Model prescribes how
the Data Model is represented in XML, specifically RDF.
This document provides all the details a programmer would need to implement a metadata
manipulation system such as the XMP Toolkit SDK (which is available from Adobe).

- Part 2, Additional Properties, provides detailed property lists and descriptions for standard XMP
metadata schemas; these include general-purpose schemas such as Dublin Core, and special-purpose
schemas for Adobe applications such as Photoshop¬Æ. It also provides information on extending
existing schemas and creating new schemas.

- Part 3, Storage in Files, provides information about how serialized XMP metadata is packaged into XMP
Packets and embedded in different file formats. It includes information about how XMP relates to and
incorporates other metadata formats, and how to reconcile values that are represented in multiple
metadata formats.
