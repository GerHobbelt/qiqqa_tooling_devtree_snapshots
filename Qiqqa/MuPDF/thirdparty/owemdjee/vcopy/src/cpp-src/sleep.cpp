     Usage:
       sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX...]
       sleep [options]

       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the default),
         'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.  NUMBER need not be an
         integer.  Given two or more arguments, pause for the amount of time
         specified by the sum of their values.

     Options:
       -h --help              Show this screen
       --version              Show version
