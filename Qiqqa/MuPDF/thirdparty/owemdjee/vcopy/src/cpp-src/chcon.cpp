R"(chcon.

     Usage:
       chcon [options] CONTEXT FILE...
       chcon [options] [ -u USER ] [ -r ROLE ] [ -l RANGE ] [ -t TYPE ] FILE...
       chcon [options] --reference=RFILE FILE...

       Change the SELinux security context of each FILE to CONTEXT.
       With --reference, change the security context of each FILE to that of RFILE.

     Options:
       --help             Show this screen
       --version             Show version
       --dereference         Affect the referent of each symbolic link (this is
                               the default), rather than the symbolic link itself
       -h, --no-dereference  Affect symbolic links instead of any referenced file
       -u, --user=USER       Set user USER in the target security context
       -r, --role=ROLE       Set role ROLE in the target security context
       -t, --type=TYPE       Set type TYPE in the target security context
       -l, --range=RANGE     Set range RANGE in the target security context
       --no-preserve-root    Do not treat '/' specially (the default)
       --preserve-root       Fail to operate recursively on '/'
       --reference=RFILE     Use RFILE's security context rather than specifying
                               a CONTEXT value
       -R, --recursive       Operate on files and directories recursively
       -v, --verbose         Output a diagnostic for every file processed

       The following options modify how a hierarchy is traversed when the -R
         option is also specified.  If more than one is specified, only the final
         one takes effect.
       -H                    If a command line argument is a symbolic link
                               to a directory, traverse it
       -L                    Traverse every symbolic link to a directory
                               encountered
       -P                    Do not traverse any symbolic links (default)
