R"(truncate.

     Usage:
       truncate [options] FILE...

       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size
         A FILE argument that does not exist is created.
         If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.
         If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (hole)
           reads as zero bytes.

     Options:
       -h --help              Show this screen
       --version              Show version
       -c, --no-create        Do not create any files
       -o, --io-blocks        Treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes
       -r, --reference=RFILE  Base size on RFILE
       -s, --size=SIZE        Set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes

     Note:

       SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying characters:
         '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least,
         '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.
