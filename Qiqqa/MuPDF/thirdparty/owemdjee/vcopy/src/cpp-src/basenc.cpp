     Usage:
       basenc [options] ( FILE | [-] )

         Print NAME with any leading directory components removed.
         If specified, also remove a trailing SUFFIX.

     Options:
       -h --help             Show this screen
       --version             Show version
       -d, --decode          Decode data
       -w, --wrap=COLS       Wrap encoded lines after COLS character (default 76)
       -i, --ignore-garbage  When decoding, ignore non-alphabet characters\n\
       --base64              Same as 'base64' program (RFC4648 section 4)
       --base64url           File- and url-safe base64 (RFC4648 section 5)
       --base32              Same as 'base32' program (RFC4648 section 6)
       --base32hex           Extended hex alphabet base32 (RFC4648 section 7)
       --base16              Hex encoding (RFC4648 section 8)
       --base2msbf           Bit string with most significant bit (msb) first
       --base2lsbf           Bit string with least significant bit (lsb) first
       --z85                 Ascii85-like encoding (ZeroMQ spec:32/Z85);
                               when encoding, input length must be a multiple of 4;
                               when decoding, input length must be a multiple of 5

     Notes:

     When decoding, the input may contain newlines in addition to the bytes of
       the formal alphabet.  Use --ignore-garbage to attempt to recover
       from any other non-alphabet bytes in the encoded stream.
       The data are encoded as described for the basenc alphabet in RFC 4648.
