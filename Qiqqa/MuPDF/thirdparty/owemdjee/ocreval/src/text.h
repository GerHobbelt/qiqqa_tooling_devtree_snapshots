 *  This module provides definitions and routines to support the reading
 *  and writing of OCR-generated text.  A "Text" structure is defined to
 *  be a linked list of "Char" structures, where each "Char" structure
 *  gives the value of one 32-bit Unicode character and indicates whether it
 *  is suspect.
