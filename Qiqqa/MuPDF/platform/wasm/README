# MuPDF WASM Library

This is a build of MuPDF targeting WASM environments.
The MuPDF WASM Library can be used both in browsers and in Node.

The way to use it is via a Javascript module.

The WASM library is very similar in design and use to the Java library.
The same classes and methods can be used in the same way - but there are also
a few conveniences available here thanks to the dynamic nature of Javascript
that are not available in the Java API.

## Building

The WebAssembly build has only been tested on Linux at the moment. If you use
any other platform, you are on your own.

In order to build this you will need to install the Emscripten SDK in
/opt/emsdk. If you install it elsewhere, you will need to edit the build.sh
script to point to the appropriate location.

        https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html

From the mupdf platform/wasm directory, you can run build.sh to build the WebAssembly
library. The results of the build are a mupdf-wasm.wasm binary and
mupdf-wasm.js script, placed in the "bin/" directory.

The mupdf-wasm.wasm binary is quite large, because it contains not only the
MuPDF library code, but also the 14 core PDF fonts, various CJK mapping
resources, and ICC profiles. In order to keep it as small as possible, it is
built with a minimal features set that does not include CJK fonts, EPUB
support, etc.

In lib/mupdf.js is a module that provides a usable Javascript API on top of
this WASM binary. This library works both in "node" and in browsers.

## Examples

The example web application in viewer/mupdf-view.html shows how to use the MuPDF
WASM library to create a PDF viewer that runs in the browser.

Another example is examples/mutool.js which re-implements some of the usual
mutool commands. This script can be run from the command line using Node.
