free advice from the internet, UNBILLED(!ye gods!) like this? That's what seasoned Dutch professionals, in a full and frank exchange of views, formulate as "daar hebben we eens heerlijk onze reet mee afgeveegd."

A psychologist, whom I rank at the very pinnacle of my list of people I deeply respect, she smiled and asked me once if I might be able and willing to try a surprising different tac. That was ~20 years ago.

Today I'll try my best to show I can yet learn and listen to my friends' and other well-meaning peoples' advice: generally, my texts are too long. As in: if I could *somehow* apply a 10-base logarithm on it, it might get in sensible range.
Hence, I'll be succinct this once. Wish me luck.

Sometimes it turns out that a problem is not just a problem but truly a *stack* of problems, at several levels of abstraction, all at the same time. Regrettably, somebody landed you in one of those.

- I see "non-IFRS". Magnificent! Those are *signal words* that somebody is having great fun already. You are not that someone.
- are you intimately familiar with both these professional jargon terms?
  + due diligence
  + risk factor analysis
  not just with the rather signular financial focus, but also applied to other fields, e.g. STEM engineering?
- you are aware that OCR technology (not just tesseract, but everyone in this field) is neural nets, and thus essentially statistical in nature?
- tesseract output discrepancies vs. the image original are the least of your worries.
- do you, at any level, realize that you are about to apply a statistical gun to corporate financial data / are willingly injecting a noise signal of indeterminate significance into a stream of financial data produced for corporate performance processing of any kind (evaluation / monitoring / ranking / whatever-else-your-bosses-call-this)
- and if you go "statistical gun" WTF? then do know that this is a real, existing concept and neither google nor wikipedia instant gratification will be on offer (I checked), yet it is a very real thing. 

- I was flabberghasted when I was 20, couple decades later I'm still flabberghasted, but nothing has changed: not a single CS major (including CS masters) have had control engineering as part of their curriculum (except the rare individual that chose to mix CS with electronics on route to an embedded engineering specialization): CS is the only "technical" education tract which does not have at least a basic level of control engineering education as part of their curriculum.
