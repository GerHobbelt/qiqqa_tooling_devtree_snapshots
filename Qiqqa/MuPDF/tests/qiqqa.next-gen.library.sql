-- # BibTeX format
--
-- The following are the standard entry types, along with their required and
-- optional fields, that are used by the standard bibliography styles. The
-- fields within each class (required or optional) are listed in order of
-- occurrence in the output, except that a few entry types may perturb the
-- order slightly, depending on what fields are missing. These entry types
-- are similar to those adapted by Brian Reid from the classification scheme
-- of van Leunen [4] for use in the Scribe system. The meanings of the
-- individual fields are explained in the next section. Some nonstandard
-- bibliography styles may ignore some optional fields in creating the
-- reference. Remember that, when used in the bib file, the entry-type name
-- is preceded by an @ character.

-- ## Fields
--
-- Below is a description of all fields recognized by the standard
-- bibliography styles. An entry can also contain other fields, which are
-- ignored by those styles.
--
-- address
--     Usually the address of the publisher or other type of institution. For
--     major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends omitting the
--     information entirely. For small publishers, on the other hand,
--     you can help the reader by giving the complete address.
-- annote
--     An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography styles,
--     but may be used by others that produce an annotated bibliography.
-- author
--     The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the LATEX
--     book.
-- booktitle
--     Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LATEX book
--     for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title field instead.
-- chapter
--     A chapter (or section or whatever) number.
-- crossref
--     The database key of the entry being cross referenced.
-- edition
--     The edition of a book--for example, ``Second''. This should be an
--     ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as shown here;
--     the standard styles convert to lower case when necessary.
-- editor
--     Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LATEX book. If there
--     is also an author field, then the editor field gives the editor of
--     the book or collection in which the reference appears.
-- howpublished
--     How something strange has been published. The first word should
--     be capitalized.
-- institution
--     The sponsoring institution of a technical report.
-- journal
--     A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals; see
--     the Local Guide.
-- key
--     Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label when
--     the ``author'' information (described in Section 4) is missing. This
--     field should not be confused with the key that appears in the \cite
--     command and at the beginning of the database entry.
-- month
--     The month in which the work was published or, for an unpublished work,
--     in which it was written. You should use the standard three-letter
--     abbreviation, as described in Appendix B.1.3 of the LATEX book.
-- note
--     Any additional information that can help the reader. The first word
--     should be capitalized.
-- number
--     The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a work in
--     a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually identified
--     by its volume and number; the organization that issues a technical
--     report usually gives it a number; and sometimes books are given
--     numbers in a named series.
-- organization
--     The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes
--     a manual.
-- pages
--     One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42-111 or
--     7,41,73-97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates pages
--     following that don't form a simple range). To make it easier to
--     maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard styles convert
--     a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash used in TEX to denote
--     number ranges (as in 7-33).
-- publisher
--     The publisher's name.
-- school
--     The name of the school where a thesis was written.
-- series
--     The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire book, the
--     the title field gives its title and an optional series field gives the
--     name of a series or multi-volume set in which the book is published.
-- title
--     The work's title, typed as explained in the LATEX book.
-- type
--     The type of a technical report--for example, ``Research Note''.
-- volume
--     The volume of a journal or multivolume book.
-- year
--     The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year it was
--     written. Generally it should consist of four numerals, such as 1984,
--     although the standard styles can handle any year whose last four
--     nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as `(about 1984)'.
