# Submitting Changes

- pull request (some folks elsewhere want an issue with that, but I don't: the pull request has its own number and is another kind of issue in the github tracker, clearly visible and easily manageable.)

  When a pull request is for a specific **existing issue** in the github tracker, please reference the issue number in your pullreq message.
  
- `git push --all` when you've been registered as a collaborator

  **Note**: the Qiqqa project has an additional shell script for this, because Jimme didn't make me a full admin, so I sync to both my own fork (full control there!) and his repo (collaborator with limited rights).
